2. image rec, nlp, 
3. idk
4. idk
5. idk
6. graph process unit. allows processing data in parallel
7. 2
8. oh
9. ok
10. you need to program behaviour instead of letting computer figure it through learning
11. each neuron has a weight
12. parameters
13. basically the image of [[Training Loop]]
14. the decision is hidden inside hundreds of layers
15. idk 
16. data, labels and an architecture
17. the model can predict higher crime in a zone leading to more policing which increases crime catching and so on
18. no. bigger images may lead to better results but require more computational power and time.
19. classification creates predictions for labels on a test set. Regression predicts continuous values such as tabular values
20. Validaton set is used during each epoch so that the model can update its parameters. Test set is used at the end to give the loss to human.
21. it will create its own from the training data (20 percet)
22. No, validation set should be separate than training set.
23. When the model starts learning the data instead of the paterns.ex: model learns how to recognize each image of a dog from the training set, but when a new dog is shown it cant
24. a metric is for human consumption.Loss is for validation and training
25. They already have preset weights from training with a variety of datasets
26. the last layer in the neural network
27. simple features like general shapes. later layers recognize more complex structures like faces
28. no. many forms of data can be turned into images and trained using cnn
29. the model used 
30. model that colors pixels and sections of an image
31. idk
32. idk 
33. avoid overfitting. use pretrained models, gather lots of data
