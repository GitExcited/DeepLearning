# The state of Deep Learning

- [[Computer Vision]]
	Object recognition, object detection (where is the object in the image) and a variant of object detection called [[Segmentation|segmentation]]
- *Text* [[Natural Language Processing]]
	- Good for classifying documents based on categories. 
	- Good at generating context-appropriate replies and texts. 
	As a general rule, text generation models will always be a bit ahead of models for recognizing generated text (just keep improving your text generator until the recognizer fails)
- *Combining text and images*
	- Good at finding captions for images.
- *Recommendation Systems*
	- Good at using tabular data to find recommendations. This works by creating a matrix with customers as rows and columns as products. Then "filling" the matrix for customers who seem to buy similar products.
