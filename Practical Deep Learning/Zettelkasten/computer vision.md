### Types
**Object Recognition**: 
	Recognize items in an image
**Object Detection**:
	Recognize where objects in an image *are*
	Variant of this is [[Segmentation]] (Coloring Pixels)
### Limitations
**Out-of-domain Data**:
	Model might have trouble recognizing types of images *not present in training*
	Ex: It training data didn't contain any black and white images model might do poorly with them
**Image Labelling**:
	Can be *slow* and *expensive*. 
	A way to solve this is using [[Data Augmentation]]
