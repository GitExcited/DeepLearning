# Test set 
>[!warning] The problem:
>Just as the [[Validation Set]] is meant to be hidden while the model is being trained to avoid bias, it is possible to introduce a new bias even with a validation set. This happens when a human, guided by the validation set, shape the [[hyperparameters]]. The human sees the results from the validation set and adjusts the hyperparameters to get better results, thus [[Overfitting]] the data.
- Thus we must keep a set of reserved data, **test set**. 
- The test set is used only at the *very end* of our training.
