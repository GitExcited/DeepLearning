# Overfitting

- Occurs when the you train the model too long on the [[training set]]. The [[Validation Set]] accuracy will improve for a while, but eventually it will get worse as the model memorizes the training set rather than finding patterns in the data.
>[!Danger] Overfitting is the single most important and challenging issue when training data
- Only use methods to avoid overfitting after confirmation that overfitting is occurring (A noticeable dip in accuracy during training)
