# head
- The last couple [[Network layer|layers]] in a neural network
- When using [[pretrained models]], the head is deleted an one or more new layers replace it. This new head has random weights.
- In general, when the model is being [[fit|fit]], it updates the weights of the late layers (especially the head) faster than the earlier layers.
