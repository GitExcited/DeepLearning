# Drivetrain Approach

# Build useful models:

1. Consider your *objective* 
- What are you trying to accomplish?
2. What *levers* can you control?
- The inputs you can modify
3. What *data* can you collect?
4. Build *model* where levers influence data to get closer to objective

>[!example] Example drivetrain approach
> **Recommendation engine**:
> The objective is showing the user items they'd be interested in. The levers are the ranking of the recommended items. The data is the users and their purchases. By creating one (or many) model(s), you can train them to learn what recommendations are the most liked (or return the most sales...)
