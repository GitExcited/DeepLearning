# Deep Learning
- Specialized type of [[machine learning]] that uses [[Neural network]] with multiple [[Network layer|layers]] 


>[!quote] If we can figure out a way to automatically test the effectiveness of any current **weight assignment** in terms of *performance* AND provide a mechanism for **altering weight** assignment to *maximize performance* then we see the machine would "learn" from its experience
\- Arthur Samuel (IBM researcher) 1962 essay "Artificial Intelligence: A frontier of Automation"

## Jargon
- The *model* is called **architecture**
- The *weights* are called **parameters**
- The *input* not including **labels** is the **independent variable**
- The *result* are called **predictions** 
- The *performance* is called the **loss**
- The **loss** depends on the **predictions** but also the correct **labels**
![[NN jargon.png]]
- **Classification model**: Attempts to predict a label
- **Regression model**: Attempts to predict one or more numeric quantities. (unrelated to linear regression approx. models)
